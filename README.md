## Usage

### Login

The `login` command is used to authenticate the Tenderly CLI with your [Tenderly Dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.dev).

```
tenderly login
```

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --authentication-method | / | Pick the authentication method. Possible values are email or token |
| --email | / | The email used when authentication method is email |
| --password | / | The password used when authentication method is email |
| --token | / | The token used when authentication method is token |
| --force | false | Don't check if you are already logged in |
| --help | / | Help for login command |

### Init

The `init` command is used to connect your local project directory with a project in the [Tenderly Dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.dev).

```
tenderly init
```

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --project | / | The project name used for generating the configuration file |
| --create-project | false | Creates the project provided by the --project flag if it doesn't exist |
| --re-init | false | Force initializes the project if it was already initialized |

### Push

The `push` command is used to add your contracts to the [Tenderly Dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.dev).

| --networks | / | A comma separated list of network ids to push |
| --tag | / | Optional tag used for filtering and referencing pushed contracts |
| --help | / | Help for push command |

#### Advanced usage

It is possible to push to multiple projects by editing the `tenderly.yaml` file and providing a map of projects and their networks. To do this remove the already provided `project_slug` property and replace it with the `projects` property like the example below;

```yaml
projects: # running tenderly push will push the smart contracts to all of the provided projects
  my-cool-project:
    networks:
    - "1" # mainnet
    - "42" # kovan
  my-other-project:
    # if the networks property is not provided or is empty the project will be pushed to all of the migrated networks
  company-account/my-other-project:
    # if you want to push to a shared project provide the full project identifier
    # the identifier can be found in you Tenderly dashboard under the projects name
```

### Export init

The `export init` subcommand helps define network in interactive mode.

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |

```
tenderly export init
```

### Export

```
tenderly export {{transaction_hash}}
```

#### Command Arguments

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| transaction hash | Hash of local transaction to debug |

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --export-network | / | Export network name located in tenderly yaml |
| --project | / | The project name |
| --rpc-address | / | Json rpc server address (example: 127.0.0.1:8545) |
| --forked-network | / | In case you forked a public network (example: mainnet) |
| --help | / | Help for export command |

#### Advanced usage

```yaml
exports: # running tenderly export will export local transaction to the provided project
  my-network:
    project_slug: my-cool-project
    rpc_address: 127.0.0.1:8545
    forked_network: mainnet
    chain_config:
      homestead_block: 0 # (default 0)
      eip150_block: 0 # (default 0)
      eip150_hash: 0x0 # (default 0x0)

    rpc_address: rpc.ethereum.company:8545
    # if you want to export to a shared project provide the full project identifier
    # the identifier can be found in you Tenderly dashboard under the projects name
```

### Verify

The `verify` command uploads your smart contracts and verifies them on [Tenderly](https://tenderly.dev).

```
tenderly verify
```

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --networks | / | A comma separated list of network ids to verify |
| --help | / | Help for verify command |

### Proxy Debugging

The proxy server is currently made to work with the [Truffle framework](https://truffleframework.com/) and requires the proxy to be run from the root of your Smart Contract project where the Truffle configuration is located.

```
// Example using Ganache defaults
tenderly proxy --target-port 7545
```

In your Truffle configuration, configure your local network config to point to the running proxy or create a new network for proxy debugging.

```
module.exports = {
    networks: {
        //...
        proxy: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 9545,
            network_id: "*",
            gasPrice: 0
        },
        ganache: {
            host: "127.0.0.1",
            port: 7545,
            network_id: "*",
            gasPrice: 0
        },
        //...
    }
};
```

After setting up the network you can now call your Truffle commands just as before by changing the `--network` to the appropriate one.

```
$user > truffle exec ./scripts/test-scripts.js --network proxy
Using network 'proxy'.


Error: 0x0 Error: REVERT, execution stopped
	at require(square == original)
		in FailContract:5

...
```

Now when your transactions fail you can see the exact line of code in which the error occurred and the whole stacktrace by using our proxy command.

#### Note

You must run `truffle migrate --network proxy` first, so the contract information (address to source mapping) can be picked up by the `proxy` command from the `build` folder.

#### Command Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --path | "./" | Path to the project build folder where your Truffle configuration is located |
| --proxy-host | "127.0.0.1" | Host on which the proxy will be listening |
| --proxy-port | "9545" | Port on which the proxy will be listening |
| --target-host | "127.0.0.1" | Target host of your Blockchain RPC |
| --target-port | "8545" | Target port of your Blockchain RPC |
| --target-schema | "http" | Blockchain RPC protocol |
| --write-config | / | Write proxy settings to the project configuration file |
| --help | / | Help for proxy command |

### Check for updates

The `update-check` command checks if there is a new version of the Tenderly CLI and gives update instructions and changelog information.

### Version

The `version` command prints out the current version of the Tenderly CLI.

```

### Who am I?

The `whomai` command prints out basic information about the currently logged in account
